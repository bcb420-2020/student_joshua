This repo contains the code and files used for the BCB420 Course

The purpose of this project was to do gene analysis on the dataset from GEO for paper Human Telomerase RNA Processing and Quality Control

To see the full analysis go to this link

The files A1t.Rmd, A2t.Rmd and A3.Rmd contian the code used for the data analysis 

A1t.Rmd was for Data Processing

A2t.Rmd was for Differential Gene Expression Analysis

A3.Rmd was for Pathway and Network Analysis

Using Kniter these Rmd files were used to create their respective HTML files
